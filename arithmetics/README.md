# This code is a simple program that takes a number as input from the user and performs some calculations using loop code breakdown step by step. In summary, the code takes a number from the user and performs multiplication, addition, and subtraction calculations using loops to display the results.

1 The code includes the standard input/output library, stdio.h, which provides functions like printf and scanf.

2 The main function is the entry point of the program.

3 Three integer variables are declared: num to store the user input, and x and y for intermediate calculations.

4 The printf function is used to display a prompt asking the user to enter a number.

5 The scanf function is used to read an integer value from the user and store it in the num variable.

6 The first loop is a for loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive). In each iteration, it multiplies the num with the loop counter x and   assigns the result to y. Then it prints the equation and the calculated value using printf.

7 The puts function is used to print a newline character, creating some space between the two sections of calculations.

8 The second loop is a while loop that iterates as long as i is less than or equal to 10. In each iteration, it adds the i to num and       assigns the result to y. Then it prints the equation and the calculated value using printf. After each iteration, i is incremented by 1.

9 The puts function is used again to create some space between the second and third sections of calculations.

10 The third loop is a do-while loop that first executes the code block and then checks the loop condition. It starts with k equal to 1 and continues as long as k is less than or equal to 10. In each iteration, it subtracts k from num and assigns the result to y. Then it prints the equation and the calculated value using printf. After each iteration, k is incremented by 1.

11 Finally, the main function returns 0, indicating successful program execution.
